   * @ingroup event_handling
   * @brief Constructed on top of an MPI communicator, this class helps to monitor and communicate events across
   * multiple processes.
   *
   * @details The root process (rank == 0) monitors all other processes. If a process encounters an event, it sends a
   * message to the root process by calling monitor::report_local_event. The root process then broadcasts this
   * information to all other processes.
   *
   * It can be used to check
   * - if an event has occurred on any process (monitor::event_on_any_rank) or
   * - if an event has occurred on all processes (monitor::event_on_all_ranks).
   *
   * It uses a duplicate communicator to not interfere with other MPI communications. The communicator is freed in the
   * `finalize_communications` function (which is called in the destructor if not called before).
   *
   * All functions that make direct calls to the MPI C library throw an exception in case the call fails.
